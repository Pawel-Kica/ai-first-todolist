Title: Task Tags

Context

- What: This feature will introduce a tagging system, allowing users to add, view, and filter tasks by tags.
- Why: To improve task organization and make it easier for users to categorize and find specific tasks.
- Scope: The feature includes creating tags, assigning them to tasks during creation and editing, displaying them on the task list, and filtering by tags. Tag deletion and management will be out of scope for this iteration.
