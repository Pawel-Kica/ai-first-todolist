## Simple Plan

A Simple Plan is a minimal planning artifact: take a feature and generate the simple user stories for it—nothing more.

### Simple Plan — Guidelines

- Provide only what is necessary to execute. Keep it brief and outcome-oriented.
- Focus on user stories; avoid technical implementation details.
- Structure in this order: Title → Context → User stories.
- Output: Save the plan under `docs/plans/plan-<kebab-case-feature>.md` and begin the file with `Title: <feature name>`.

### Template

```markdown
Title: <concise feature name>

Context

- What: <1–2 sentences explaining the change>
- Why: <business or technical driver>
- Scope: <what is in / out>

Simple user stories (without benefit, outcome, reason)

- As a <user/persona>, I can <capability>
- As a <user/persona>, I can <action>
- As a <user/persona>, I can <thing>
```
