## Simple Plan

A Simple Plan is a minimal planning artifact: take a feature and generate the simple user stories for it—nothing more.

### Simple Plan — Guidelines

- Provide only what is necessary to execute. Keep it brief and outcome-oriented.
- In user stories:
  - avoid technical implementation details in user stores, "Implementation Notes" is a right section for it
  - avoid benefit, outcome, reason. Just "As a user, I can..."
- Structure in this order: Title → Context → User stories → Implementation notes
- Output: Save the plan under `docs/plans/plan-<kebab-case-feature>.md` and begin the file with `Title: <feature name>`.

### Output Template

```markdown
Title: <concise feature name>

Context

- What: <1–2 sentences explaining the change>
- Why: <business or technical driver>
- Scope: <what is in / out>

User stories

- As a <user/persona>, I can <capability>
- As a <user/persona>, I can <action>
- As a <user/persona>, I can <thing>

Implementation Notes:

- Couple of bullet points that describes how this feature will be implemented
```

### Simple Plan - Checklist

1. Make sure the following sections are present: Title, Context, User Stories, Implementation Notes.s
2. Plan is saved under `docs/plans/plan-<kebab-case-feature>.md`
